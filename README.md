# Substrate Node Template

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```


### Connect with Polkadot-JS Apps Front-end

Once the node template is running locally, you can connect it with **Polkadot-JS Apps** front-end
to interact with your chain. [Click

local node template.

## Template Structure

A Substrate project such as this consists of a number of components that are spread across a few
directories.
